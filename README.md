This is an elementary web scraping tool that will scrape 100 resumes from indeed and parese out information such as company names, job titles, duration of job, education institution, and degree of education earned. After scraping the data from each of the resumes, the data will be arranged neatly into a dataframe that can easily be exported to an excel file. This tool can scrape 100 resumes in less than a few minutes and neatly output information into a readable excel file. Something that could be an extremely useful resource for Human Resource managers that are trying to find worthy candidates for any job position.
